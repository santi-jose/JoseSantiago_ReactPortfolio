# Jose Luis Santiago - SPA Portfolio React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This is a SPA React web application. We have a navbar which directs us to one of three different pages: Home, About, and Contact. The root path '/' routes us to the Home page.  

The inspiration for the design of the website is from Earthbound 2's character screen. 

There are four components of this web app. 
1. Navbar: This component renders the navbar which routes us to our different pages using the react-dom-router package.
2. Home: The home component welcomes visitors and has project cards which detail the extent of my skills.
3. About: The About component gives a deeper perspective into who I am as a developer and person. It details my areas of interest as well as my client work and educational experience.
4. Contact: This contact component shows a contact card with details on how to reach me if my services are requested.
